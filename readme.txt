- Make sure the following node module are installed : path, request, cheerio, fs

-No need to re-scrapt the restaurants from michelin, the json is already in the folder (along with the javascript scrapt if you need to see how i did)

- I couldn't make an app with React, so i tried my best to have a clean output of restaurant deals in console

- The list of restaurant from michelin is already scrapted, but not the deals from lafourchette, so it might takes some time for the APIs to be executed

- The programm displays all the restaurant with michelin star, and tells you if a current deal is available or not. 

- A preview (image) in the folder top-chef shows what is supposed to be displayed on console


* Open a console (cmd for windows..etc)
* Execute the file deal.js in top-chef/docs/js by writing    'node %PathTo(deal.js)'
